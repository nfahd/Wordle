**Wordle Clone**

This project is a Wordle clone built to replicate the fun and challenge of the original word-guessing game. 
The game provides players with six attempts to guess a hidden word, with feedback provided on each guess to help narrow down the possibilities.

**Features**

Classic Wordle Gameplay: Guess a hidden word in six attempts with real-time feedback.

Keyboard Integration: Virtual keyboard for easy input.

Visual Feedback: Color-coded tiles indicate correct letters, misplaced letters, and incorrect guesses.

**How to Play**

Type your guess using the keyboard or on-screen keys.

Press **Enter** to submit your guess.

Feedback is displayed:

**Green**: Letter is in the correct position.

**Yellow**: Letter is in the word but the wrong position.

**Gray**: Letter is not in the word.

Continue guessing until you solve the word or exhaust your six attempts.

**Known Issues**

Restarting the Game: There is no dedicated "Start" or "Restart" button. To restart the game, refresh the page.

**Future Optimizations**

Dynamic Word List: Integrate the WordsAPI to fetch new words dynamically.

Difficulty Levels: Add support for multiple difficulty levels to enhance gameplay for beginners and advanced players.
